Description: Epistatic relationship matrix based genomic prediction of phenotypes in R. It does the phenotype prediction based on two statistical models:
    First, Epistatic Random Regression BLUP (ERRBLUP) model as a full epistatic model with all pairwise SNP interactions. For ERRBLUP prediction of phenotypes, ERRBLUP relationship matrix should be initially calculated.
    Second, selective Epistatic Random Regression BLUP (sERRBLUP) model as a reduced epistatic model. A selected subset of pairwise SNP interactions based on estimated effects or estimated effects variances are included in sERRBLUP model. For sERRBLUP prediction of phenotypes, sERRBLUP relationship matrix should be initially calculated based on Pairwise SNP interaction effects or their variances. These could be done by the EpiGp package.
    The provided dataset for the example of each function of the package is the wheat dataset markers and respective simulated phenotypes. The phenotypic trait is simulated by randomly selection of 80 SNPs from marker matrix and generating phenotype based on all 4 possible genotype combinations resulting in purely epistatic trait with the heritability of 1.
