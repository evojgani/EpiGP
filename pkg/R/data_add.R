#'
#' @description Simulated phenotypes by R-package MoBPS for two correlated traits with the phenotypic and genomic correlarion of \code{0.9} from Wheat dataset ("BGLR" package) genotype by randomly selection of \code{80} SNP pairs from marker matrix and generation of the phenotypic traits based on all 4 possible genotype combinations \code{{00, 02, 20, 22}} of \code{{0,2}} coded markers resulting in purely epistatic traits with the heritability of \code{0.8}
